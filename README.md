# Pomodoro-timer


> The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

### Some notes:

It was not necessary to put `<LengthControls />` as a separate component but I did it to learn how to pass props and states from child to parent.

Sounds may not work in Safari at the moment.
